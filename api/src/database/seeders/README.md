## Running the Seeders

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure your database is set up and migrations are run:
```bash
npm run typeorm migration:run
```

2. Set up your environment variables in `.env`:
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_DATABASE=saitex_db
```

### Run the Seeder

```bash
# Run all marketing data seeders
npm run seed
```

This will:
1. Clear existing marketing data
2. Seed products, customers, and campaigns
3. Generate orders with realistic patterns
4. Create campaign metrics with daily data
5. Update calculated fields (customer totals, product sales)

## Data Quality

The seeded data includes:

### Realistic Patterns
- Seasonal sales spikes in November-December
- Weekday vs weekend order patterns
- Customer purchase behavior based on loyalty tiers
- Product performance variation by category

### Business Intelligence Ready
- Complete customer journey data
- Product performance metrics
- Campaign attribution data
- Revenue and profitability tracking
- Time-series data for trend analysis

### AI-Friendly Data
- Rich metadata for natural language queries
- Structured relationships for joins
- Balanced data distribution
- Realistic business scenarios

## Sample Queries

After seeding, you can test the insight module with queries like:

```sql
-- Top selling products
SELECT name, total_sold, total_revenue FROM products ORDER BY total_sold DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Customer loyalty distribution
SELECT loyalty_tier, COUNT(*) FROM customers GROUP BY loyalty_tier;

-- Monthly sales trends
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) as month, SUM(total_amount) as revenue
FROM orders GROUP BY month ORDER BY month;

-- Campaign performance
SELECT name, type, impressions, clicks, conversions, return_on_ad_spend
FROM marketing_campaigns ORDER BY return_on_ad_spend DESC;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Error**
   - Check your `.env` file configuration
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running
   - Verify database exists

2. **Migration Required**
   ```bash
   npm run typeorm migration:run
   ```

3. **Permission Issues**
   - Ensure database user has CREATE, INSERT, DELETE permissions
   - Check TRUNCATE permissions for clearing data

4. **Memory Issues**
   - The seeder uses batch processing for large datasets
   - If you encounter memory issues, reduce batch sizes in the seeder

### Re-running Seeders

The seeder will automatically clear existing marketing data before inserting new data. It's safe to run multiple times.

## Customization

To modify the seeded data:

1. **Change quantities**: Edit the loop counts in `marketing-data.seeder.ts`
2. **Adjust date ranges**: Modify `randomDate()` calls
3. **Add new categories**: Update the arrays in seed methods
4. **Custom patterns**: Modify the business logic in seed methods

## File Structure
